Welcome to a new gently verison of Dungons and Dragons. In Dungons and
Dragons, you travled through a maze fighting monsters and gathering treasure.
Here the object is to meet the characters in the maze and make them happy.
The way to make them happy is to give them what they want.  So you must
determine what they want and then find it and give it to them.  You win
when all the characters are happy.  There will be friendly monsters and
not so friendly monsters.  There are only nine rooms so not a huge
maze. You have the same numbers of lives as there are monsters.  So do
not get attacked by each more then once!

hug
Sometimes a monster just needs a hug.  Hugging a monster may make him talkative,
it may make him him want to give you an item or it may make him want to punch
your lights out.

talk
talking is a good way to get to know a monster.  He may tell you what he wants.
He may tell you that he has an item.  He may jsut ignore you or he may open a
can a whoop ass and give you a full serving!

steal
stealing from ones friends is not a good idea but from a vile beast.  Hey it
may work.  You have to know what it is you are stealing.  since you are a master
theft you have a good chance of being succesful.  You aslo have a good chance of
being beaten like a rug!

give
Giving is what life is all about.  Giving someone that thing they really want
make them happy and makes you happy.  But giving a monster something they do
not want is likely to get you slapped silly.  You will ba asked what you wish
to give and you need to have that item in your backpack

search
Giving a monster a pat down search is always a good idea. NOT! However, it
is a good way to determine if a monster has an item.  It is also a good way
to maybe get a fat lip!  You will be asked what item you wish to search for.

search
Tossing a room looking for something is always fun.  It is even more fun
when a monster is in the room.  You will be asked what item you wish to
search for and you never know how a monstr will react to you looking
through his mothers drawers.... or cabinets.

get
Once you find and item a room, get will place that item in your backpack.
You will be asked what item you wish to get.

look
look will tell you which room you are in and describe the room.  It will
also tell you if there is a monster in the room and describe him to you

backpack
backpack will provide you with a list of items in your backpack
